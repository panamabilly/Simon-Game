        <p>The Simon game consists of four colored buttons, each producing a light flash when a button is pressed by a player or a light flash is added to the light sequence which is generated by the gameboard.</p>
        <p>A round in the game consists of the Simon gameboard lighting one button in a random order, after which the player must reproduce that order of the entire light sequence by repeating the flashing light sequence from start to finish.</p>
        <p> Each time a round has been complete the light sequence will be incremented by one. The player has won the game if they complete 8 rounds or a score of 80 points and will see the crazy color light sequence indicating the end of the game.</p>
        <p>When you are ready to start the game, please press the grey button on the gameboard. The the status button on the scoreboard will display gameover if the player enters the wrong button sequence and the game can be restarted by pressing grey button again.</p>
        <p> Please wait for the scoreboard to clear to restart the game after losing and after winning wait until the crazy light sequence ends to start again!!
